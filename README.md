## 👋 hello

**We write your reusable computer vision tools. 💜**

## Project Overview

Supervision is an open-source Python library designed to simplify the development of computer vision applications. It provides a collection of modular, reusable tools that address common tasks in computer vision, such as object detection, tracking, annotation, and dataset management. By leveraging Supervision, developers can accelerate their workflows, reduce complexity, and focus on building innovative solutions.

### Key Features

- **Model Agnostic**: Supports various computer vision models, including Ultralytics, Transformers, and MMDetection.
- **Inference**: Easily integrate with Roboflow for model inference.
- **Annotators**: Provides tools for annotating images and videos with bounding boxes, masks, and more.
- **Datasets**: Simplifies loading, splitting, merging, and saving datasets in popular formats like COCO, YOLO, and Pascal VOC.
- **Metrics**: Calculate common evaluation metrics like mAP, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Tracking**: Incorporate object tracking capabilities with ByteTrack integration.
- **Video Processing**: Utilities for handling video frames, FPS monitoring, and video file manipulation.

### Goals

The Supervision project aims to:

- **Enhance System Monitoring**: Offer real-time insights into the performance of computer vision models, detecting anomalies and ensuring optimal operation.
- **Improve Security & Compliance**: Ensure the library adheres to security best practices and industry standards, protecting user data and ensuring compliance.
- **Optimize Performance**: Provide efficient, optimized code that leverages hardware acceleration where possible.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive API with comprehensive documentation and examples to make it accessible to developers of all levels.
- **Scalability**: Support large-scale datasets and real-time processing requirements, making it suitable for both small projects and enterprise-level applications.

### Why Supervision?

Developing computer vision applications can be complex and time-consuming, requiring expertise in multiple areas such as object detection, tracking, annotation, and dataset management. Supervision addresses this by providing a unified, easy-to-use interface for these common tasks, allowing developers to focus on their specific application logic rather than reinventing the wheel.

### Expected Outcomes

By using Supervision, developers can expect to:

- Reduce development time for computer vision projects.
- Improve the reliability and performance of their vision systems.
- Benefit from a community-driven library that is continuously updated and improved.

## 💻 install

Pip install the supervision package in a
[**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
pip install supervision
```

Read more about conda, mamba, and installing from source in our [guide](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/).

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file to store sensitive configuration:

```bash
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

Then load them in your code:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # Load before other imports
# Now use os.getenv() to access values
```


## 🔥 quickstart

### models

Supervision was designed to be model agnostic. Just plug in any classification, detection, or segmentation model. For your convenience, we have created [connectors](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/core/#detections) for the most popular libraries like Ultralytics, Transformers, or MMDetection.

```python
import cv2
import supervision as sv
from ultralytics import YOLO

image = cv2.imread(...)
model = YOLO("yolov8s.pt")
result = model(image)[0]
detections = sv.Detections.from_ultralytics(result)

len(detections)
# 5
```

<details>
<summary>👉 more model connectors</summary>

- inference

  Running with [Inference](https://github.com/roboflow/inference) requires a [Roboflow API KEY](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication#retrieve-an-api-key).

  ```python
  import cv2
  import supervision as sv
  from inference import get_model

  image = cv2.imread(...)
  model = get_model(model_id="yolov8s-640", api_key=<ROBOFLOW API KEY>)
  result = model.infer(image)[0]
  detections = sv.Detections.from_inference(result)

  len(detections)
  # 5
  ```

</details>

### annotators

Supervision offers a wide range of highly customizable [annotators](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/annotators/), allowing you to compose the perfect visualization for your use case.

```python
import cv2
import supervision as sv

image = cv2.imread(...)
detections = sv.Detections(...)

box_annotator = sv.BoxAnnotator()
annotated_frame = box_annotator.annotate(
  scene=image.copy(),
  detections=detections)
```

### datasets

Supervision provides a set of [utils](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/datasets/core/) that allow you to load, split, merge, and save datasets in one of the supported formats.

```python
import supervision as sv
from roboflow import Roboflow

project = Roboflow().workspace(<WORKSPACE_ID>).project(<PROJECT_ID>)
dataset = project.version(<PROJECT_VERSION>).download("coco")

ds = sv.DetectionDataset.from_coco(
    images_directory_path=f"{dataset.location}/train",
    annotations_path=f"{dataset.location}/train/_annotations.coco.json",
)

path, image, annotation = ds[0]
    # loads image on demand

for path, image, annotation in ds:
    # loads image on demand
```

<details>
<summary>👉 more dataset utils</summary>

- load

  ```python
  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...,
      data_yaml_path=...
  )

  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_pascal_voc(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...
  )

  dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_coco(
      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_path=...
  )
  ```

- split

  ```python
  train_dataset, test_dataset = dataset.split(split_ratio=0.7)
  test_dataset, valid_dataset = test_dataset.split(split_ratio=0.5)

  len(train_dataset), len(test_dataset), len(valid_dataset)
  # (700, 150, 150)
  ```

- merge

  ```python
  ds_1 = sv.DetectionDataset(...)
  len(ds_1)
  # 100
  ds_1.classes
  # ['dog', 'person']

  ds_2 = sv.DetectionDataset(...)
  len(ds_2)
  # 200
  ds_2.classes
  # ['cat']

  ds_merged = sv.DetectionDataset.merge([ds_1, ds_2])

      images_directory_path=...,
      annotations_directory_path=...
  )
  ```

### tracking

Tracking objects in video streams is a common task in computer vision. Supervision makes it easy with its ByteTrack integration:

```python
import supervision as sv
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
tracker = sv.ByteTrack()

video_info = sv.VideoInfo.from_video_path(video_path="video.mp4")
frames_generator = sv.get_video_frames_generator(source_path="video.mp4")

with sv.VideoSink(target_path="output.mp4", video_info=video_info) as sink:
    for frame in frames_generator:
        result = model(frame)[0]
        detections = sv.Detections.from_ultralytics(result)
        detections = tracker.update_with_detections(detections)
        
        box_annotator = sv.BoxAnnotator()
        trace_annotator = sv.TraceAnnotator()
        
        annotated_frame = frame.copy()
        annotated_frame = trace_annotator.annotate(scene=annotated_frame, detections=detections)
        annotated_frame = box_annotator.annotate(scene=annotated_frame, detections=detections)
        
        sink.write_frame(annotated_frame)
```

### metrics

Evaluate your model's performance with built-in metrics:

```python
import supervision as sv

predictions = sv.Detections(...)
targets = sv.Detections(...)

# Precision calculation
precision_metric = sv.metrics.Precision()
precision_result = precision_metric.update(predictions, targets).compute()
print(f"Precision@50: {precision_result.precision_at_50:.4f}")

# mAP calculation
map_metric = sv.metrics.MeanAveragePrecision()
map_result = map_metric.update(predictions, targets).compute()
print(f"mAP@50-95: {map_result.map50_95:.4f}")
```
